# Software Development Lifecycle

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?
How does creating “user stories” help with this?**

User stories are a tool that is used by scrum teams to identify a use case that a user would desire in a program or product that is being focused on. A basic user story would simply identify who the user is, and describe what they would like to be able to do with the product and what purpose or value they would serve or provide to them. Developers and their team use these stories to bring those possibilities to life within the development lifestyle, by using coding practices that they have specifically selected to be the best or most efficient solution to the problem.

**How do I approach developing programs?
What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

I approach problems by first breaking them down into workable points that could be accomplished and then prioritizing them in a logical order that would allow me to develop each feature on top of the others in a way that is efficient, scalable, and valuable to the user. In the future, I will continue to incorporate an agile approach to projects that I work on, meaning that a problem should be looked at from all sides and focused on value to whoever may be using it. Prioritization, efficiency, scalability, and reliability are important things to keep in mind.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

A good team member in software development communicates their requirements, difficulties, and successes to other members of the team, and provides help with the overall vision of the project to other members as they encounter their own separate set of issues. Not only should a team member address problems, but keep all others involved in their process so that the project is understood by various teams, further making communication efficient to stakeholders, users, and anyone working directly or tangentially to the project.

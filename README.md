# Software Development Lifecycle

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**

Interpreting user needs can be done through discussions with the respective client, this is a skill that requires repetition, fine-tuning, and experience to master, it is a paramount driver for the success of a project. Extracting tangible actions that can be constructed into smaller components to build user stories is the key. User stories take in the scope of a project and dilute a feature down into a few key points - known as acceptance criteria - that give the development team bite-sized components to continue building the project and limit the scope away from the final product to reduce and refine later throughout iterations.

**How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

My future approach is to continue understanding that all members of an agile team have an equally important and impactful position on the team that correlates with the deliverance of the final product for our clients. In light of this, I would incorporate several agile processes; namely, scrum ceremonies, daily stand-up meetings, weekly sprint meetings, and accompanying retrospectives as a conclusion.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

Simply, being a good team member in software development is being a team member that communicates frequently and honestly with all members of the team. Contribute value to all meetings by voicing concerns, praise, or any feedback that is applicable. This approach invariably produces transparency across the board, building trust and confidence in your teams, and ownership in your product.
